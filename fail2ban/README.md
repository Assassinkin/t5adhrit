# Fail2ban [WIP]

Todo: Check datepattern

### This was during configuring fail2ban to keep a FreeIPA server safe:

Install it using `yum` or `apt-get` or `nix-env`

Need to set up firewalld/iptables to allow all traffic and only bans non needed IP addresses who want to brute force things

Let's discuss firewalld in our case:
* we need to install firewalld and set the zone to trusted named `freeipa` is this case
* Only deny access to given IPs using firewalld's rich rules:
`firewall-cmd  --zone=freeipa --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="172.16.119.1" port protocol="tcp" port="22" reject'``
__Note__: This is not permanent as it is not permanent banned in fail2ban anyway


Change firewalld interface: `firewall-cmd --zone=public --change-interface=eth0`
Change zone default behaviour: `firewall-cmd --zone=public --set-target=ACCEPT --permanent`
