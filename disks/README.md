# Disk formatting and encryption

### Encrypting filesystem:

* Create a file system (ext4 in this case):
`mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdf`
* Encrypted the newly formatted disk:
`cryptsetup -y luksFormat /dev/sdf`: Enter the encryption password in this step
* Open/Unlock the encrypted device and give it a name (`data`):
`cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdf data`
* Format the encrypted device:
`mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/data`
* Finally mounted Volume:
`mount /dev/mapper/data /data`

 __Whenever w need to close the encrypted device we can use:__
`cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/data`

__Whenever we need to resize the encrypted volume__

```bash
cryptsetup resize /dev/mapper/data
xfs_growfs /dev/mapper/data
```

### Other usefull stuff:
To check if our system support encryption to disks:
`grep -i config_dm_crypt /boot/config-$(uname -r)`.

To make sure we have the cryptsetup utility:

```
$ lsmod | grep dm_crypt
$ modprobe dm_crypt
$ lsmod | grep dm_crypt
```
To install it, Run: `yum/apt-get install cryptsetup`

* check filesystem type: `lsblk -f`
* fix xfs filesystem (make sure it is not mounted) : `xfs_repair /dev/xvdg`

### Resizing disk with parted

First make sure parted is installed

_This is to make sure the root volume is MBR (msdos) and not GPT_

```
parted /dev/xvda print

Disk /dev/xvda: 17.2GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B

```

```
